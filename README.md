# Twitter clone frontend built using ReactJS, React Router and TailwindCSS. [WEBSITE](https://fullstack-twitter-clone-frontend.vercel.app)

This project is the frontend for a Fullstack Twitter Clone. (This project along with the server was earlier a monorepo which has been seperated into individual repositories for deployment. Checkout [this](https://github.com/prajotsurey/fullstack-twitter-clone) repository for the mono repo structure and old commits.)

## Overview
This is a replica of the Twitter App. This is the first project I have built after completing the fullstackopen 2021 course. Over the course of making this app I learned how to use Tailwind CSS. I already had a basic idea of building fullstack app but this was my first encounter with complex database structures.

I also learned how to read documentation and find solutions to problems which at first glance seem way too complex and obscure to be solved by a newcomer.

I chose Tailwind CSS for this project as I found it to be a very different than any other methodology of writing CSS I had previously encountered. I found it very easy to use and with a gradual learning curve.
